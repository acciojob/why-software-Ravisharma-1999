    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I have always been fascinated by technology and its potential to solve problems and improve lives. Becoming a software developer allows me to harness this passion and creativity to build innovative solutions. The ability to create something from scratch, whether it's a simple utility or a complex application, excites me. Moreover, the constantly evolving nature of technology ensures that there is always something new to learn and master, which keeps me motivated and challenged. Ultimately, I want to contribute to shaping the future through software development, making a positive impact on the world around me.
